<h1>Demo website for Pitmasters Back Alley BBQ</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  This is my first Bootstrap Project based off a fake E-Commerce website for Pitmasters Back Alley BBQ. It's loosely modeled after the real restaurant. It follows along with my first HTML and CSS projects. It has three pages - home, menu, and about. It features a table with fictitious prices, and a list of contact information. It also includes images on each page.
</p>

<h2> Wireframe </h2>

<p> This is my plan for the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The wireframe was created on Canva.com</p>
